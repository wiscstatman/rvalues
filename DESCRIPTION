Description: A collection of functions for computing "r-values" from various kinds of user input such as MCMC output or a list of effect size estimates and associated standard errors. Given a large collection of measurement units, the r-value, r, of a particular unit is a reported percentile that may be interpreted as the smallest percentile at which the unit should be placed in the top r-fraction of units.
